I am going to write a program in C+2 now, a non trivial one. It will define a model, view, and controller for a console line application
that acts as a random number guessing game.

// Model.cp2

- use:
    time.h
    stdlib.h

access write

class Model:

    func generateRandomNumber(min : int, max : int) -> int:
        srand(time(NULL))

        return rand() % max + min

    func generateResponse(guess : int, number : int) -> bool:
        if guess > number:
            write("Too large")
        orif guess < number:
            write("Too small")
        else:
            write("Correct")
            return true

        return false

Notes: I changed bool - to bool instead of truthval. As I typed truthval, it felt weird; bool is a traditional type. I think I am
going to use bool instead of truthval.

I also made a new library named write that contains the function write. Actually I think I should name them different things. But still,
that library will probably be in C+2.

I also accidentally typed // Model.cp2. It should be # Model.cp2.

# Controller.cp2

class Controller:

    func sendMessage()

I don't want to finish this thing. MVC for a console app is just to weird to implement. My MVC was weird in the fact that the Model
was (in my opinion) not just containing functions for the logic but also for the control flow of the program, which should not happen
(I think). But anyway, I think I like programming in C+2. Or at least I don't dislike it.
