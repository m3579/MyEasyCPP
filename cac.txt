- Must be interoperable with C++
- Syntax must be easy to read and learn
- Must be modern and not old-school
- Programs be at most no more than about 3-4x as large as Python equivalents
- Must have library to make C++ simpler (Smooth)
    - Smooth must contain equivalents for the built in functions in Python
- Must natively be simpler than C++
- Must eliminate steep learning curve for C++
- Goal is for language to be almost as easy to use as Python
