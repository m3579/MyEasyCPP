I decided that instead of trying to implement my own smart pointer system, I will use the smart pointer classes that
already exist in the API. They satisfy all the conditions I want for smart pointers in my language, and more.

They also give me the ability to (with std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr) to introduce a weak/strong reference system
like in Objective-C.
