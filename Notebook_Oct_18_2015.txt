I was looking at my previous sample, and I realized it still looked ugly. I want it to be as simple as Python:

import random

f = open("randInts.txt")

limit = 100

for i in range(limit):
    f.write(randome.randint(1, limit))

f.close()

My code is a lot longer than this: let's see what we can do.

access smooth

use fstream

define LIMIT 100

start

    init writer : ofstream ("randInts.txt")

    if not writer.is_open():
        $write("An error occurred while trying to write to the file")

    for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
        writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

    writer.close()

end

We can start by taking out the end.


access smooth

use fstream

define LIMIT 100

start

    init writer : ofstream ("randInts.txt")

    if not writer.is_open():
        $write("An error occurred while trying to write to the file")

    for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
        writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

    writer.close()

We can also make this neater by not defining LIMIT as a macro.

access smooth

use fstream

start

    init writer : ofstream ("randInts.txt")

    limit : const int = 100

    if not writer.is_open():
        $write("An error occurred while trying to write to the file")

    for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
        writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

    writer.close()

Actually, instead of const, there has to be a better way of declaring it

limit : int := 100

No...how about

const limit : int = 100

No...

constant limit : int = 100

Too long...

How about removing the requirement for a data type? Let the compiler infer it
or use the C++11 auto keyword.

Yes, I think I will do that. Let me update the BNF.


access smooth

use fstream

start

    init writer : ofstream ("randInts.txt")

    limit = 100

    if not writer.is_open():
        $write("An error occurred while trying to write to the file")

    for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
        writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

    writer.close()

Smooth should contain functions that do the equivalent of Python's built in functions.

At this point, I think I will define some criteria:

- Must be compatible with C++ (compiles to C++, includes C++, can be included by C++)
- Syntax does not need to be compatible with C++

When I say "Must be compatible with C++", I think I mean...interoperability (I just googled it to
make sure it meant what I thought it meant).

- Must be interoperable with C++
- Syntax must be easy to read and learn
- Must be modern and not old-school
- Must be at most no more than about 3-4x as large as Python equivalents

I think I will take out the third one (it is not measureable)

- Must include Smooth library
    - Smooth must contain equivalents for the built in functions in Python

I will put all of this in a file named cac.txt (criteria and constraints).

I think I will use the syntax

...

limit : constant int

No,...

set limit : int = 100

Yes.

I have updated the BNF.

Back to the sample, let me simply rewrite it from scratch except using something like pseudocode:

access smooth

start

writer : ofstream("randInts.txt")

Let me stop here. I think that it is okay if I leave out the "init", because the call should not be
ambiguous to a function call.

access smooth

start

writer : $file("randInts.txt")

set LIMIT = 100

for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
    writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

writer.close()

I want to make a shorthand for "access smooth"...maybe have it automatically included? No, it would bloat
up programs. ...I don't think there is a way to bypass this.

Let's look at the Python and C+2 programs side by side:

(Actually, let me first put "start" into the BNF because it seems like I haven't done that)

############

import random

file = open("randInts.txt")

limit = 100

for i in range(limit):
    file.write(random.randint(1, limit))

file.close()

############

access smooth

start

writer : $file("randInts.txt")

set LIMIT = 100

for i from 1 -> LIMIT:
    writer <-- $rand(1, LIMIT)

writer.close()

############

I think this looks pretty good! They are about the same size and about the same
readability.

The compiler should generate a warning, however, if a type is declared implicitly.
Now the resulting C++ code will only be compatible with C++11.

-------------------------

The $ sign is not a valid C++ identifier, so I am going to need to find some way to
mimic it in C++ source files. I could use __, but what if something is already named that?
Or similarly named that, more likely? I could use _SMOOTH_XXX. Yes, I think that will work.

I am going to write the Smooth library in C++ now.

-------------------------

As I am writing this library, I have decided that arrays will not be pure C++ arrays, but
will instead be std::array.

Actually, I think that it will be normal c-style arrays, but it will be recommended to use
std::array instead. What I mean by this is that the declaration

a : Int[] of 2

Will produce

int a[2]

but it will be recommended to use std::array over this.

After I thought about it, I will need an end keyword to signal the end of the main function.

------------------------------

I thought about implementing my own classes to substitute the ones provided in the C++ STL, but I
decided just to subclass them instead.

-------------------------------

Actually, it might not be safe to do that. I don't want do define my own classes because then any
C++ code will not be compatible with the classes in C+2, so I think I will just define functions
to handle standard classes more nicely instead of create new classes with nice methods.

-------------------------------

As I was writing methods (I mean, functions) in Smooth.hpp, I realized that I did not have a template mechanism. I added
this syntax to the BNF:

func something<type>()

something<type>() # call the function

--------------------------------

For an error handling mechanism, I have decided that the generated main function should wrap all of its body in a try-catch
that will catch any thrown errors. This will only work if the main function is written in C+2.
