Today I sorted out some bugs in the lexer. Most of these bugs are caused by me simply forgetting to move to the next character
in a test, causing an infinite loop. I also redirected the output to a file named output.txt because there was more output than
the console window could scroll up.

The test file compiled well, even with the new "static" keyword I just added. It ran through, and I am about to look at the results.

I tweaked the format of the output. I will look at it later...
