I am working on the lexer right now. I fixed the bug that it wouldn't go past the first line (I had accidentally included it
in the other characters that the program should exit after), but after testing, there are some more bugs. I introduced a temporary
construct, stoptesting, that will stop the lexer at that point in the program as if the program ended there, to ease testing. Right
now, I am fixing a bug that the program does not recognize a tab (I think that that is what it is).
